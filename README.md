# fog-map-path-dragonCity
Dragoncity is a mobile game about dragon breedings and battles. It includes several
mini-games. One of them is fog map. Every cell has a different cost to visit for
first time, and the cost becomes 5 afterwards. The goal is to unlock as many important
items (goals) with the available points. 

This program recieves a map (in map.py) and the starting points and goals to
identify the best path starting on the start and passing through every goal (in the
given order).
